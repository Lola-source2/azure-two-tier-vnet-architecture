# azure-two-tier-vnet-architecture
This project focuses on security and seamless communication between multiple virtual networks. Two virtual networks (VNets) were deployed to enable secure and efficient connectivity.  To ensure seamless communication, VNet peering was implemented, allowing traffic to flow securely between the networks without the need for additional gateways.
